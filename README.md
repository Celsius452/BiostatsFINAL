#In this repository you will find a master word document named "Final written portion.docx" that will include our written responses and generated images to answer the prompt. 

#Furthermore, you may find raw rmd/qmd files containing the code for each section of the final. These files will contain "Dataset 1/2/3" in their names. Images generated from each of these R documents can also be found with sensible related names. 

#Please consider 'Final written portion.docx' the final submission of our responses to the questions asked in the Final Prompt.

#Please consider "bt1194_FinalProject_Dataset1_NBA.rmd", "dm5153 Final Project - Dataset 2.qmd", and "Dataset#3.qmd" as our code for each portion of the final, respectively.

#Rendered HTMLs of the previously mentioned rmd/qmd files can also be found using the same naming conventions.

#Images generated from each rmd/qmd file have also been included, using sensible names. 

#Dataset 1 was worked on by Brandon and Jessica, Dataset 2 was worked on by Devin, and Dataset 3 was worked on by Mudra.



#Thanks and enjoy your winter! :)
